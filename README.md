# Church Suite Diary

A small js app to show events from the [ChurchSuite](https://github.com/ChurchSuite) [embeded calendar json feed](https://github.com/ChurchSuite/churchsuite-api/blob/master/modules/embed.md#calendar-json-feed), primarily intended for [Woodlands Church](https://woodlandschurch.net/) in Bristol, UK.

You can see it in action at [https://sauntimo.github.io/churchsuite-diary](https://sauntimo.github.io/churchsuite-diary/).

Note; uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) modals and therefore requires Bootstrap css and js files. You may wish to use a stripped down version only including modal functions and consider methods of avoiding styling collisions.
